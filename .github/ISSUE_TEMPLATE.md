**Do you want to request a feature, report a bug or ask a question?**

**What is the current behavior?**

**What is the expected behavior?**

**If the current behavior is a bug, please provide the steps to reproduce, at least part of webpack config with loader configuration and piece of your code.**
**The best way is to create repo with minimal setup to demonstrate a problem (package.json, webpack config and your code).**
**It you don't want to create a repository - create a [gist](http://gist.github.com) with multiple files**

**If this is a feature request, what is motivation or use case for changing the behavior?**

**Please tell us about your environment:**

- Node.js version: ?
- webpack version: ?
- svg-sprite-loader version: ? 
- OS type & version: ?

**Other information (e.g. detailed explanation, stacktraces, related issues, suggestions how to fix, links for us to have context, eg. stackoverflow, gitter, etc)**
